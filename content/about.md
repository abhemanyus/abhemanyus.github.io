I’m a senior backend engineer with three years of hands-on experience in web development, specializing in designing and maintaining robust backend systems. 

I lead and mentor teams, driving projects to success with proficiency in TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Go, MongoDB, and Rust. 

My expertise includes building scalable, high-performance systems on AWS, and I thrive on solving complex problems while championing clean, maintainable code. 

An agile enthusiast, I consistently deliver projects on time and within budget. 

I’m also deeply committed to the open-source community, actively contributing to various projects and libraries.
